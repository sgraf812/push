# push

Lua library implementing knockout.js-like observable properties.

## So... what exactly?
When dealing with keeping multiple data layers in sync as common in GUIs (View-ViewModel or View-Model relations), it is easy to introduce bugs and unfocused code blocks. 
The actual intent is shadowed by syncing boilerplate for all form fields/model bindings. 

That is especially true for HTML applications, where databinding is additionally complicated by DOM access, and here [knockout.js](http://knockoutjs.com/) kicks in. This library tries to provide the observable part as a modular core for other projects. It is actually written in [MoonScript](http://moonscript.org/) and as such the lua files are a nice autogenerated byproduct (and nothing more to me).

## Zzz...
By now your eyes pretty much fast forwarded to the code samples... Anyway, assume `local push = require "push"` has happened before each snippet. There will always be a MoonScript example first, then lua.

### Properties
*push's* building block.
```
p = push.property "foo", "my property" -- (initial val, descriptive name)
assert p! == "foo" -- get
p "goo" -- set
assert p! == "goo"
assert p("hoo") == "hoo" -- set returns new value
assert p.name == "my property"
```
```
local p = push.property("foo", "my property") -- (initial val, descriptive name)
assert(p() == "foo") -- get
p("goo") -- set
assert(p() == "goo")
assert(p("hoo") == "hoo") -- set returns new value
assert(p.name == "my property")
```

### Push notifications
This is were it gets interesting...
```
p = push.property! -- default initialization to (nil, "<unnamed>")
val = nil
p.push_to (nv) -> val = nv -- handle property changes
p "bar"
assert val == "bar"
```
```
local p = push.property() -- default initialization to (nil, "<unnamed>")
local val = nil
p.push_to(function(nv) val = nv end) -- handle property changes
p("bar")
assert(val == "bar")
```

### Readonly: A writeproxy example
The usual OO info hiding stuff: Restrict clients to get access, while internally being able to set stuff. The implementation demonstrates a possible usage of the writeproxy method.
```
p = push.property "zazoo"
get = push.readonly p -- proxies writes to error
assert get! == "zazoo"
assert not pcall get, "kazoom" -- writing to p is not allowed
p "kazoom"
assert get! == "kazoom" -- still propagates changes from wrapped property
```
```
local p = push.property("zazoo")
local get = push.readonly(p)
assert(get() == "zazoo")
assert(not pcall(get, "kazoom"))
p("kazoom")
return assert(get() == "kazoom")
```

### Computed properties
This is the main reason to use *push*. It makes binding form fields a calk walk, because property changes are literally pushed into each dependant property, thereby using a reasonable caching policy:
```
p = push.property "foo"
buzzer = push.computed -> p! .. "buzz" -- the reader computes new dependent value
assert p! == "foo"
assert buzzer! == "foobuzz"
p "bar"
assert buzzer! == "barbuzz"
```
```
local p = push.property("foo")
local buzzer = push.computed(function() 
  -- the reader computes new dependent value
  return p() .. "buzz"
end)
assert(p() == "foo")
assert(buzzer() == "foobuzz")
p("bar")
return assert(buzzer() == "barbuzz")
```
'Can't I write to it?', I hear you think. Yes you can!
```
first = push.property "john"
last = push.property "doe"
reader = -> first! .. " " .. last!
writer = (nv) ->
  f, l = nv\gmatch("(%w+) (%w+)")!
  first f or ""
  last l or ""
  nv
full = push.computed reader, writer, "my fullname"
assert full.name == "my fullname" -- yeah, can still have that
assert full! == "john doe"
full "ron foe" -- interesting bit
assert first! == "ron"
assert last! == "foe"
```
```
local first = push.property("john")
local last = push.property("doe")
local reader
reader = function()
  return first() .. " " .. last()
end
local writer
writer = function(nv)
  local f, l = nv:gmatch("(%w+) (%w+)")()
  first(f or "")
  last(l or "")
  return nv
end
local full = push.computed(reader, writer, "my fullname")
assert(full.name == "my fullname") -- yeah, can still have that
assert(full() == "john doe")
full("ron foe") -- interesting bit
assert(first() == "ron")
return assert(last() == "foe")
```
Now if you don't want a referenced property to push to your `computed` value, use `peek()`:
```
a = push.property 1, "changes too often"
b = push.property 2, "changes often enough"
c = push.computed -> a\peek! + b!
assert c! == 3
a 15
assert c! == 3 -- the reader isn't even run
b -3
assert c! == 12 -- but when b changes, the new value of a is used
```
```
local a = push.property(1, "changes too often")
local b = push.property(2, "changes often enough")
local c = push.computed(function()
  return a:peek() + b()
end)
assert(c() == 3)
a(15)
assert(c() == 3) -- the reader isn't even run
b(-3)
return assert(c() == 12) -- but when b changes, the new value of a is used
```
This where all basic features.
